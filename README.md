# PRTG-Offline-Sensor-Reporter

## Summary
Collects sensors with statuses: down, down (acknowleged), down (partial), or unknown 
and can be further filtered with exclusion groups. This data will be formatted into 
an Opsgenie alert so it can be viewed inside a Slack channel via the Opsgenie/Slack 
integration. If the script errors out, it will notify specified Slack channels.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
This script is ideal for a daily checkup before production hours begin. This 
enables our team to tackle any issues that crop up with customer devices 
before our customer's day begins. That way, we ensure device reliability,
stability, and efficiency for our customers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- loguru
- python-dotenv
- requests

## Usage
- Environment variables need to be set to specify Opsgenie API token, Opsgenie
  team IDs/user IDs/escalation IDs/schedule IDs/title/tags for the alert, PRTG 
  access, PRTG exclusion substrings for probes/groups/devices/sensors, logger 
  configurations, Slack access, and Slack channel IDs for errors.

- Simply run the script using Python:
  `python PRTG_Offline_Sensor_Reporter.py`

## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.12.2.
