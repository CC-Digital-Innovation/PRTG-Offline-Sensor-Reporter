# PRTG-Duplicate-Device-Finder

## Summary
This script will make an Opsgenie alert that reports any unknown, down, down
(acknowledged), or down (partial) sensors in a given instance of PRTG.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Provides insight for the current downed sensors in PRTG in order for those
sensors to be corrected. This helps ensure that the devices being monitored in 
PRTG are online and fully operational.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9.5
- configparser >= 5.0.2
- requests >= 2.25.1

## Usage
- Add any additional filtering logic to the API URLs to get specific
  devices if desired.
    - _Make sure you configure filtering options accordingly. Available
      options for filtering can be found on the PRTG API:
      https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/live_multiple_object_property_status#advanced_filtering_

- Add any additional desired fields in the Opsgenie API call.
    - Reference to the Opsgenie API: https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/api-overview

- Add additional device properties to make records include more information
  about a device.

- Edit the config.ini file with relevant PRTG / Opsgenie access information.

- Simply run the script using Python:
  `python PRTG-Offline-Sensor-Reporter.py`

## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.9.5.
